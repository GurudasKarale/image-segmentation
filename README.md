# Thresholding

__Image segmentation can be done using Thresholding.__

__Isodata and otsu are image segmentaton techniques using thresholding.__ 

__Isodata thresholding:__

1)Find the histogram of the image.

2)Calculate the mean.

3)Loop until previous threshold is not equal to next threshold.




4)Convert image into binary image by assigning, pixel values above threshold as 255 and and pixel values below threshold as 0.
